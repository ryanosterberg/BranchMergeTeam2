Activity #2 – Branch and Merge
Team

Everyone Branch at the same time from dev
Each person add a unique file containing your home address to the project, Commit, and Push.
One person at a time:
	1. Merge Dev into your branch
	2. Make a pull Request
	3. Once approved by the team, merge, delete your branch


Merge Conflicts
We have not gotten a merge conflict up until now because we have only added additional things to our project.
A merge conflict arises when the same lines of code differ between the two branches you are merging.  
The computer will force you to resolve the merge conflict.

Click on the tan merge conflict notification at the top of the window.

Once you have resolved the merge conflict:
	• Commit and push your changes.
	• Test the branch.
